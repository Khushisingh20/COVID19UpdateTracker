How it helps to solve the problem?
We present the system architecture and estimation methods of Covid-19 Update Tracker, which uses open surveys to monitor the progress of the pandemic. Our graphical estimations require large amounts of data from active participants, but provide insightful depictions of the progress of the pandemic in different regions, offering an estimation of the cumulative and active number of cases in our country. 

Frameworks/Technologies stacks to be used
We are using Html, CSS , JavaScript and APIs for our project. APIs are needed to bring applications together in order to perform a designed function built around sharing data and executing pre-defined processes. They work as the middle man, allowing developers to build new programmatic interactions between the various applications people and businesses use on a daily basis.

How easily can your solution be implemented and how eﬀective will it be?
Covid-19 updates tracker can provide near real-time contact traceability to quickly identify and manage infections at the municipal or community level, predict the need for medical resources in order for it to be allocated where necessary, and measure compliance with local emergency guidelines and regulations.

Future Scope
Contact tracing helps protect you, your family, and your community by:
Helping people diagnosed with COVID-19 get referrals for services and resources they may need to safely isolate.
Notifying people who have come into close contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19 and helping them determine what steps to take, depending on their vaccination status and history of prior infection . Follow-up may include testing, quarantine, and wearing a well-fitted mask.
Discussions with public health workers are confidential. This means that your personal and medical information will be kept private and only shared with those who may need to know, like your healthcare provider.
